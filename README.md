# the-cacti-collection
a series of games created by me
It is important to note that none of these games will be on this repository, this will just be a way for the community to give ideas and groundwork for the future.
If you can remake the games somehow on this repository that would be appreiciated.
(what this basically means is that i don't know how to use github.)
(most of this will be on scratch)
